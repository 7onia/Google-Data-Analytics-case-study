# Background
Cyclistic launched its bike-share program in 2016, achieving significant success. The program now boasts a fleet of 5,824 bicycles, all equipped with geotracking and housed at 692 stations across Chicago. Riders can pick up a bike from any station and return it to any other station within the system, available for use at any time.

To date, Cyclistic's marketing strategy has centered on creating general awareness and targeting broad consumer segments. Individuals who buy single-ride or full-day passes are called casual riders. Those who opt for annual memberships are identified as Cyclistic members.

The director of marketing, Moreno, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. 

So, the main goal is to design marketing strategies focused on converting casual riders into annual members.
